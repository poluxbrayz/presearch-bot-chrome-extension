## Introduction

Hello, world!

Not that long ago, [Presearch](https://presearch.com/signup?rid=4334054) got announced to the world, a search engine what gives you free crypto.
The search engine it selves sucks, but what I made doesn't. This is Cleo, the Presearch bot. The only working one (currently). Why did I call it Cleo? I don't know.

This tool allows you to:

-   Earn money without doing anything
-   Bypass the rate limits
-   Earn up to 2.5 PRE every day
-   And that's it. Yeah, I didn't knew anything else to put here lol
<br/>


## Installation

Just wanted to say, if you enjoyed my project, please consider using my [referral link](https://presearch.com/signup?rid=4334054).

To start, download the latest [release](https://github.com/lgamerlive/presearch-bot/releases/latest) from my GitHub page and download it. Unzip the file and put the files in a folder (see [this](https://i.vgy.me/VADfFk.png) image, if you even need help with that).
Now, navigate to your browsers extension page.

    Chrome/Chromium-based browsers: chrome://extensions/
    Microsoft edge: edge://extensions/
    FireFox: about:addons

Now, you need to enable Developer Mode (see image) ![Enabling Developer Mode in Google Chrome](https://i.vgy.me/QnoRyz.png)
Select "Load Unpacked"
![Does anybody read this?](https://i.vgy.me/1xmnQz.png)
And choose the folder where you unzipped the files to.
<br/>

## FAQ

**Why are there... questionable ads on your website?**

_I need money. You don't need to click on the ads. Do not trust any pop-ups/ads. I'm not responsible for any type of damage on our device._

**I CAN JUST WAIT TO GET REDIRECTED LOLOLOLOL**

**_You don't need to click on the ads._** _but if you want to support me, please turn off your adblocker on our website. We really need money, and our ads are the only way we can continue our project._

Is the extension available in the Chrome web store?

_No, and it probaly never will be._
